# FOODIE
Created with CodeSandbox
I have created this frontend project using different technologies like HTML5 , CSS3 , JS , BOOTSTRAP and REACT
There are 7 major components of this website 
1. Navbar
2. Home
3. About
4. work
5. Testimonial
6. Conact
7. footer
All these 7 components of jsx are combined in final App.js file
I have used different react libraries for using logos,icons etc.
